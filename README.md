## 🎯 About

This isn't your grandfather's portfolio website. Built with Next.js 13 and styled with TailwindCSS, this portfolio showcases projects, skills, and experiences in a way that makes even binary look beautiful. It's responsive, performant, and probably smarter than my smartphone.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 Modern and sleek UI design (because we're not in the 90s anymore)
- 📱 Fully responsive (works on everything from a smartwatch to a smart fridge)
- 🚀 Next.js 13 powered (yes, we're living in the future)
- 🎭 Dark/Light mode (because choice matters)
- 📊 Dynamic project showcases
- 📝 Blog section (where we pretend to be tech influencers)
- 📬 Contact form (that actually works!)
- 🎯 SEO optimized (Google will love you)
- 🔥 Lottie animations (because static is so yesterday)

## 🛠️ Installation

First, clone this repository. Don't worry, it won't bite:

```bash

```

Install dependencies (grab a coffee, this might take a moment):

```bash
npm install
# or if you're feeling fancy
yarn install
```

Set up your environment variables (yes, we actually need these):

```bash

```

Run the development server:
